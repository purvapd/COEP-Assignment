;To generate different waveforms using a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) on an X86 microprocessor, we need to write assembly code to output different values to the DAC at regular intervals. Here are examples of programs to generate ramp, triangle, square, and sine waveforms using the X86 microprocessor.

;Note: These programs assume that the DAC is connected to the microprocessor's parallel port and that the port is configured in output mode. The specific addresses used to access the parallel port may vary depending on the hardware configuration.

;Ramp waveform:
;A ramp waveform is a linearly increasing waveform that starts at a minimum value and goes up to a maximum value. To generate a ramp waveform, we can write a loop that outputs values to the DAC in a linearly increasing sequence.

    mov cx, max_val         ; set maximum DAC value in CX
    xor ax, ax              ; clear AX register
    
loop:
    out dx, al              ; output current DAC value
    inc al                  ; increment DAC value
    loop loop              ; loop until maximum value is reached
    jmp $                   ; infinite loop
	
	
Triangle waveform:
;A triangle waveform consists of a linearly increasing waveform followed by a linearly decreasing waveform. To generate a triangle waveform, we can modify the ramp waveform program to output values in a zigzag pattern.

    out dx, al              ; output current DAC value
    cmp al, max_val         ; check if maximum value is reached

cont:
    loop loop              ; loop until maximum value is reached
    jmp $                   ; infinite loop

;Square waveform:
;A square waveform consists of a high-level signal followed by a low-level signal of equal duration. To generate a square waveform, we can write a loop that alternates between outputting the maximum DAC value and the minimum DAC value.

    out dx, al              ; output minimum value
    jmp loop                ; loop indefinitely

;Sine waveform:
;A sine waveform is a smooth waveform that varies sinusoidally over time. To generate a sine waveform, we can use a lookup table of precomputed values and output them at regular intervals.
