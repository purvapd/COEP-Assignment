## Problem Statement:-

Write a function squeeze (s, c), which removes all occurrences of the character c from the
string s.



### Code :- squeeze.c    
   
  The main function initializes a string str with the value "Hello, world!", prints it, calls the squeeze 
  function passing it the string and the character 'o', and then prints the resulting squeezed string. 
  The squeeze function is the same as the one I provided in my previous answer. When the program is run, 
  the output should be:


  
### Run the program.

      VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

      $ gcc squeeze.c -o squeeze


     VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

     $ ./squeeze

     Original string: Hello, world!

     Squeezed string: Hell, wrld!

     VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
