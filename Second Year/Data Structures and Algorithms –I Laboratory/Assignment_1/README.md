# Assignment_1

## Problem Statement:-

Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.

### Code_1 :- histogram.c
    
    This program is implemented in the C programming language using Data Structures and Algorithms concepts :For loop. 
    It takes input from the user as a string of characters and creates a histogram of the frequencies of each 
    character in the input string.

  

### Code_2 :- histogram_1.c

    This program is implemented in the C programming language using Data Structures and Algorithms concepts :hash table. 
    It takes input from the user as a string of characters and creates a histogram of the frequencies of each character 
    in the input string.


### Run the program.

VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

$ gcc histogram.c -o histogram
