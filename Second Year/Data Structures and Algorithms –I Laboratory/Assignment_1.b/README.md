## Problem Statement:-

Write a program to print sum of digits of a number accepted from user. Example: if the 
input number is 7654, output should be 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22.

### Code_1 :- Sum_of Digit.c
    
    This is a simple C program that calculates the sum of the digits of a number entered by the user. 
    The program uses the Data Structures and Algorithms concept that is while loop to extract each digit of 
    the number and add it to the sum.

  

### Code_2 :- Sum_of Digit_1.c

    Here's another implementation of the program using a recursive function:


### Run the program.

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ gcc sum_of_digit.c -o sum_of_digit

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ ./sum_of_digit

    Enter a number: 7654

    The sum of the digits of the number is 22
