## Problem Statement:-

Write a program to compute x^y based on using base-3 presentation of a number. In the 
program, write a function which computes x^y


### Code_1 :- base_3.c
    
    The code is a C program that computes x^y in base-3 representation, where x and y are user input integers. 
    The program uses a function called power to compute x^y. The power function converts the exponent y to base-3 
    and then computes x^y in base-3 using a loop. The program also handles negative exponents correctly.

  

### Run the program.

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
    
    $ gcc base_3.c -o base_3

    
    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
    
    $ ./base_3
    
    Enter the value of x: 5
    
    Enter the value of y: 4
    
    5 ^ 4 = 625
