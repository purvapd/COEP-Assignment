### Code_1 :- infix.c
    
    Here's an example of a function in C that evaluates an infix expression without converting it to postfix, 
    taking into account operator precedence and handling spaces, parentheses, and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /):


### Run the program.

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
    
    $ gcc infix.c -o infix

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
    
    $ ./infix
