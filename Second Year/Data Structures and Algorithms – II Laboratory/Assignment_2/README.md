## Problem Statement:-

Write code to list leaf nodes, non-leaf nodes and level of all nodes in a given binary tree


### Code_1 :- binary.c
    
This code creates a binary tree and implements three functions:

print_leaf_nodes: This function prints all the leaf nodes of the given binary tree.
print_non_leaf_nodes: This function prints all the non-leaf nodes of the given binary tree.
print_node_levels: This function prints the level of all nodes in the given binary tree.
You can modify the binary tree by changing the create_node function calls in the main function.

### Run the program.


    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ gcc binary.c -o binary



    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ ./binary

    Leaf Nodes: 4 5 6 7

    Non-Leaf Nodes: 1 2 3

    Node Levels:

    1 : 1

    2 : 2

    4 : 3

    5 : 3

    3 : 2

    6 : 3

    7 : 3
