## Problem Statement:-

Implement a decision support system for course tracking at a institute using PROLOG. A 
course is floated by a teacher from a particular department. Various students will enroll a course. Single student can enroll for multiple 
courses (maximum five per course) provided the student clears the prerequisite courses. A teacher can teach at the most two courses in a semester.

### Code_1 :- division.cpp

	To run the Prolog code, you will need a Prolog interpreter or environment installed on your system. Here are the general steps to run the code:

		1. Install a Prolog interpreter: There are several Prolog interpreters available, such as SWI-Prolog, GNU Prolog, and Sicstus Prolog. Choose 
    and install one based on your platform and preference.

		2. Create a new Prolog file: Create a new text file with a .pl extension, e.g., "course_tracking.pl", and open it in a text editor.

		3. Copy and paste the code: Copy and paste the Prolog code provided above into the "course_tracking.pl" file.

		4.Load the Prolog file: In your Prolog interpreter or environment, load the "course_tracking.pl" file. This can usually be done by typing 
    [course_tracking]. or consult('course_tracking.pl'). in the Prolog prompt.

		5. Run queries: You can now run queries in the Prolog prompt to test the functionality of the decision support system. For example, you 
    can type has_prerequisite(student1, cse301). to check if student1 has the prerequisite for enrolling in cse301, or enroll(student1, cse301). 
    to attempt to enroll student1 in cse301.
