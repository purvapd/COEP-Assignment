## Problem Statement:-

Write a function in LISP to find nth element from a list of m elements.

### Code_1 :- division.cpp

    The C++ function that uses a LISP-like syntax to find the nth element from a list of m elements. 
    However, it's important to note that C++ is not a LISP-based language and does not inherently support LISP-like syntax. 
    LISP is a completely different programming language with its own syntax and semantics. Here's an example of how you
    could implement a function to find the nth element from a list in C++ using a LISP-like syntax:
		
		
### Run the program.

    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ g++ lisp.cpp -o lisp


    VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~

    $ ./lisp

    The 2th element is: 3
