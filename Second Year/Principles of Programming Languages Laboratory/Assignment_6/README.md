## Problem Statement:-

Write a program to implement various types of geometrical shapes like circle, triangle, 
square, polygon, and octagon. Circle, triangle, square, polygon, octagon are child classes of base class shape; Square is a polygon, octagon is a polygon

### Code_1 :- geometry.cpp

    The provided C++ code implements a program that defines various geometric shapes as classes, including Circle, Triangle, Square, Polygon, and Octagon. 
    These classes are derived from a base class called Shape. The Circle, Triangle, and Square classes directly inherit from the Shape class, while the 
    Polygon class inherits from Shape and serves as a base class for the Octagon class.

### Run the program.

		$ g++ geometry.cpp -o geometry

		VSK@DESKTOP-8LMS4JT MINGW64 ~
		
		$ ./geometry
